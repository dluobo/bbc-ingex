How to install a CORBA Naming Service
=====================================

Recorders advertise themselves in the naming service and controllers
(or RecorderClient) use it to find the recorders.

root> cd ...ingex/studio/scripts
root> cp Naming_Service /etc/init.d

Now edit /etc/init.d/Naming_Service

Change the ACE_ROOT= line to reflect your ACE_ROOT
In the NAMING_OPTIONS= line, put the IP address of your machine

root> chkconfig -a Naming_Service
root> /etc/init.d/Naming_Service start
